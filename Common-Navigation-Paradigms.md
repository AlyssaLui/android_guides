## Overview

Navigation between views is an important part of any application. There are several ways to setup navigation in an Android application:

 * [ActionBar](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/actionbar.html) - Using the ActionBar and/or ActionBar tabs to switch between different views
 * [Swipe Views](http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/lateral.html) - Allow paging between views using a swipe gesture
 * [Navigation Drawer](http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html) - Displays a vertical menu that slides in to allow navigation between views 
 * [Screen Map](http://developer.android.com/training/design-navigation/descendant-lateral.html#buttons) - Providing a series of buttons on screen that can be pressed to visit different views

These four represent the most common navigation paradigms in Android applications. The specifics for how to implement these can be found in the various links above.
