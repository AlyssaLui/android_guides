## Overview

Navigation between views is an important part of any application. There are several ways to setup navigation in an Android application:

 * [ActionBar](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/actionbar.html) - Using the ActionBar and/or ActionBar tabs to switch between different views
 * [Navigation Drawer](http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html) - Displays a vertical menu that slides in to allow navigation between views 
 * [Screen Map](http://developer.android.com/training/design-navigation/descendant-lateral.html#buttons) - Providing a series of buttons on screen that can be pressed to visit different views
 * [Swipe Views](http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/lateral.html) - Allow paging between views using a swipe gesture

These four represent the most common navigation paradigms in Android applications. The specifics for how to implement these can be found in the various links above.
