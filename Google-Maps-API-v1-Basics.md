## Overview

This guide will instruct you on how to setup your android project to use the Google Maps API v1 library. There are still some instances where developers find it is useful to use this older library instead of the Google Maps API v2 which was included with Google Play Services.

This includes guides for: creating a MapView within an activity, adding markers to a MapView, customizing the on marker tap logic, and customizing the marker class itself to store whatever data you need to pass around your application.
