## Overview

JSON is text, and we can convert any Java object into JSON, and send JSON to the server. We can also convert any JSON received from the server into Java objects. This way we can work with the data as Java objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.

## Libraries

Check out these libraries for easy handling of converting to and fro JSON into Models in your apps:

 * [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.
 * [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - Moshi is a modern JSON library for Android and Java. It makes it easy to parse JSON into Java objects:
 * [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) - Jackson Project, formerly known as the standard JSON library for Java (or JVM platform in general), or, as the "best JSON parser for Java." Or simply as "JSON for Java."
