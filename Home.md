Welcome to the open-source Codepath Android Guides! Our goal is to become the **central crowd-sourced repository** for complete and up-to-date Android content and tutorials. 

We have guides for everyone whether you are beginner, intermediate or advanced. Want to learn how to [[use the ActionBar|Defining the ActionBar]], we got that. Want to learn [[about testing|Android Unit and Integration Testing]] or how to [[build flexible user interfaces for multiple devices|Flexible User Interfaces]]? We got you covered. We don't teach you the "theoretical way", we cover exactly the things we do every day as we are developing apps at startups or for contracts.

Ever been **frustrated finding information on outdated one-off blog posts and tutorials** that has since become irrelevant? How many times was your answer only on a **2 year old StackOverflow** post? We believe there's got to be a better way. Why not have the community work together to create useful and detailed documentation for every aspect of Android (or any platform)? There's absolutely no reason that we should have to make due with outdated, vague or un-editable content.

Read about our [[mission to change the way people learn new technologies|The CodePath Goal]] and we would love for you to [get involved](https://github.com/thecodepath/android_guides/wiki/The-CodePath-Goal#how-do-i-help)! 

## Introduction

The guides below are categorized by their topic, so you can easily find guides on related topics whether that is views, styling, testing, or using sensors. If you see an error, incorrect explanation or deprecated solution, why not contribute?

**Note:** We have scoured the web for content while creating these guides and adapted content from many source including the [Google Official Docs](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/index.html), [Vogella Tutorials](http://www.vogella.com/android.html) and countless others. At the bottom of every guide, there is citations for the content. We don't claim the content is original, but unlike those other sources, it is freely community contributed and editable.
