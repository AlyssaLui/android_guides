## Overview

There are many third-party libraries for Android but several of them are "must have" libraries that are extremely popular and are often used in almost any Android project. Each has different purposes but all of them make life as a developer much more pleasant. The major libraries are listed below in a few categories.

 1. [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) - A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android. 
 1. [ButterKnife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) - Using Java annotations, makes Android development better by simplifying common tasks.
