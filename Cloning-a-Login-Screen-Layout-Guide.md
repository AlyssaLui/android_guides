## Overview

This guide is going to walk us through the step-by-step process of recreating this screenshot in an Android app:

<img width="400" src="http://www.android-app-patterns.com/img/sets/login-screens/155_2_login-screens.png" />

### Cutting Assets

First, I will make the downloadable assets available. Keep in mind these were stolen right out of the screenshot and therefore their quality is pretty poor. But it demonstrates the concepts nonetheless. To create the mockup, we need the following assets:

 * [Highlight Launcher Icon](http://i.imgur.com/pysgYQU.png/ic_highlight.png)
 * [Facebook Connect](http://i.imgur.com/cTBWQMx.png/facebook_connect.png)
 * [LinkedIn Connect](http://i.imgur.com/gnOzng1.png/linkedin_connect.png)

Download those and drag them into the drawable-mdpi folder. Note that in production applications you would multiple sizes of these images for [different image densities](http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#DesigningResources). We are going to ignore that and provide only medium density for this demo.
