We are a startup called [CodePath](http://thecodepath.com). We are just two people at the moment with a vision of changing the way engineers learn and play with new technologies and languages.

As software engineers, we have a strong need to **"keep up" with the rapidly changing field of software development**. Have you ever wanted to play with a new technology and wished that you had **other engineers to play around with**, **mentors to save you countless hours** and guide your learning as well as **high-quality curriculum and projects** to make learning more fun?

**Yeah, we did too**. This is in large part why we founded [CodePath](http://thecodepath.com). We are both engineers and founders and we wanted a better way for engineers to learn exciting new languages and platforms. 

## Open-Source Documentation

When we started learning Android and iOS, we were frustrated with the "outdated", vague and deprecated guides we saw littered around the internet. Why was open-source software changing the world but if I wanted to learn about how to use fragments for Android, finding up-to-date and **practical** documentation was like pulling teeth. Often only **stack overflow** and a random blog post would be available to help me learn. And often the posts had outdated or misleading information.

We think as open-source developers and as software engineers, we can do better. Why not have a crowdsourced Android (or any platform for that matter) documentation repository that **anyone developer can edit**? Why can't we work together to **save others countless hours of pain and frustration** resulting from old blog posts and outdated tutorials?  

## Free Bootcamps

In addition, as engineers we always wish we could meet other engineers to hack with, and maybe even mentors to learn the new technologies from. Imagine how many hundreds of hours you could save if you had an experienced engineer in the trenches guiding your learning and reviewing your code. Not to mention people to hack on cool projects with. 

Still, we would want it to be free and accessible to any serious engineers looking to learn new tech. Most engineers have full-time jobs. This is why we started the [free "evening" bootcamps](http://thecodepath.com/androidbootcamp) in San Francisco. Where we run engineers in cohorts through everything they need to know to do Android or iOS development.
