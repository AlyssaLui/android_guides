[SugarORM](https://github.com/satyan/sugar) is a database persistence library that provides a simple and concise way to integrate your application models into SQLite. In contrast to [ActiveAndroid](https://github.com/pardom/ActiveAndroid), which is mature, powerful, and flexible, SugarORM is:

* Less verbose
* Quicker to set up
* More hands-free

## Install

SugarORM has no dependencies, so installation is as simple as downloading the `.jar` file and putting it in your `libs` folder. Maven central hosting is currently being [planned](https://github.com/satyan/sugar/issues/91), and this page will update with additional information whenever SugarORM becomes available on Maven.

The current stable release is [v1.2](https://github.com/satyan/sugar/releases/tag/v1.2), and this is the [jar](https://github.com/satyan/sugar/blob/master/dist/sugar-1.2.jar?raw=true).
